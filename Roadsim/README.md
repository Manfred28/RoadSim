# Roadsim

A practice project written in Python, aimed to simulate a city using ASCII characters.

The scope of the project greatly expanded while in development. Initially there had been no classes and objects involved, only the characters representing the buildings, roads, and cars, stores in an array representing their current position. The previous versions are unfortunately not available.

It was my first project involving object oriented programming, and while the current code might leave much to be desired, I learned much throughout the process of writing it.
